<h4 id="betting-provisions">BETTING PROVISIONS</h4>
<h5 id="sports-and-special-event-betting">Sports and Special Event Betting</h5>
<p>We accept bets/wagers for sporting and other special events that are advertised on the Website. All such bets/wagers are subject to the rules applicable to each sport, e.g. Soccer, Tennis, Boxing, etc. In a match between two teams where the participants are named, if any player is replaced prior to the match starting, all match bets placed prior to the change will be void, win or lose. Our general betting rules will apply to any situations not covered by the special rules.</p>
<p>The result of a match or event will be determined on the day of its conclusion for betting purposes, subject to confirmation by the relevant sport&#39;s governing body. Any subsequent enquiry that may result in an overturned decision will not be recognised by SportyBet, and original settlement of bets will stand.</p>
<p>If the venue for a sporting event is changed, all bets placed based on the original venue will be made void and stakes refunded, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<h5 id="minimum-bets-amount">Minimum bets amount</h5>
<p>The minimum bets amount for each order is the relevant value defined below based on the currency of the user’s account: GHS 1.</p>
<h5 id="maximum-winnings">Maximum Winnings</h5>
<p>The maximum winnings for each bet is the relevant value defined below based on the currency of the user’s account: GHS 12,500,000.</p>
<h5 id="related-contingency-betting">Related Contingency Betting</h5>
<p>Multiple bets which combine different selections within the same event are not accepted where the outcome of one affects or is affected by the other.</p>
<p>For example, in a football match involving Arsenal and Everton:</p>
<p>If the odds for Manchester United to win at home against Tottenham are 2.00 and the correct score odds for Manchester United to win 1-0 is 8.00, by having the multiple bet of Manchester United to win and the correct score to be 1-0, a customer would be getting 16.00 for an bet that should have odds of 8.00, as if Manchester United win 1-0 they would automatically have won the match.</p>
<p>An exception to this rule is where special odds are offered for the combined eventuality, e.g. First Player to Score/Correct Score, known as a Scorecast.</p>
<p>When the related parts of a bet are resolved at different times but still within the same tournament, the bet will be settled as instructed, with the price of the second or subsequent selection being determined at each individual stage.</p>
<p>For example, a multiple bet of:</p>
<p>Nadal to win the semi-final of Wimbledon; and</p>
<p>Nadal to win the Wimbledon tournament outright.</p>
<p>As the odds of the second selection depends on the outcome of the first, the odds of Nadal winning the tournament at the time the bet was struck cannot be used to calculate the multiple bet, and the correct odds after the initial selection is completed will be attributed instead.</p>
<p>Multiple bets which combine different selections within different events are also not accepted where the outcome of one affects or is affected by the other.</p>
<p>For example, a multiple bet selecting:</p>
<p>Formosa to win the 2000 Guineas; and</p>
<p>Formosa to win the Derby.</p>
<p>As the odds for Formosa to win the Derby depend on whether she wins the 2000 Guineas, the odds for her to win the Derby at the time the bet was struck cannot be used to calculate the multiple bet. A special price to win both races will be quoted instead.</p>
<p>In the case of all multiples including selections with related outcomes, if a bet is taken inadvertently SportyBet reserves the right to void part of or the whole of the bet.</p>
