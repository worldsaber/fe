<h4 id="what-is-cashout-">What is Cashout?</h4>
<p>Cashout is a revolutionary real-time feature that allows you control over your bet. Use it to guarantee yourself a profit, or cut your losses.</p>
<h4 id="what-ways-can-i-cashout-">What ways can I Cashout?</h4>
<h5 id="cashout">Cashout</h5>
<p>You can Cashout on your unsettled bets.</p>
<h5 id="partial-cashout">Partial Cashout</h5>
<p>You can make a Partial Cashout and leave part of the original Stake untouched. A Partial Cashout is allowed when an unsettled bet is a Single or Multiple with one combination. A Single Bet has 10 possible times to use Partial Cashout and a Multiple Bet has 5 possible times to use Partial Cashout.</p>
<h4 id="how-can-i-cashout-">How can I Cashout?</h4>
<p>Simply login to your account and select &quot;Cashout&quot; in the betslip. Bets with the &quot;Cashout&quot; icon are eligible for immediate &quot;Cashout&quot;.</p>
<p>Please, note that Cashout is only available for Bet Stakes over GHS 1.00. Moreover, bets placed using a Gift are not eligible for &quot;Cashout&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="how-much-will-i-win-">How much will I win?</h4>
<p>Your &quot;Cashout&quot; resulting amount depends on the likely outcome of your bet. The more likely it is to win, the greater the amount you can &quot;Cashout&quot; will be.</p>
