<p>Roulette is a game where the little white marble goes around a spinning wheel. A marble ball is spun around the outside of the bowl until the ball eventually stops in a division of the wheel. It is quite fun!</p>
<p>The divisions around the wheel are numbered from 1 to 12 in a seemingly random pattern and alternate between red and black colours. Additionally, there is a green division with the number 0.</p>

<p>Making a bet is easy: simply place your chip(s) on top of the number(s), color, or sets you believe the marble ball will stop on.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to make just one kind of bet for each spin, you can make as many as you like, and you win if the ball lands on any of your numbers.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important to understand that the outcome of the roulette wheel is truly random.</p>
