<h4 id="profit-introduction">PROFIT INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>&quot;Red&quot; (red side) and &quot;Blue&quot; (blue side) each hold 3 dice.
The winner is the one with the highest sum of the points on the dice thrown by the two of them. The &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; will then compete in the betting area and customers can only between the &quot;Red&quot; or the &quot;Blue&quot; to place their bets. Bets are paid in proportion of the amount placed as bets.</p>
<h4 id="cash-return">CASH RETURN</h4>
<p>1) If no bets were placed on the Red (side) or the Blue (side), the entire sum of cash placed as bets will be returned to the customers after the results are displayed;
2) If the Red and the Blue’s game ends as a tie, the entire sum of cash placed as bets will be returned to the customers after the results are displayed;
3)  If the total number of placed bets on both sides (Red and Blue) are not the same, then, the side which had the least amount placed as bets will have that amount entering the Prize Pot. In the end, the customers who bet on the side which loses, will see the amount they placed as bets enter the &quot;Prize Pot&quot; which will be won and distributed among the winning side. The winning side will then share the winnings in proportion to the betting amount that customers placed as bets.</p>

<h4 id="game-structure">GAME STRUCTURE</h4>
<ol>
<li>If you did not log in, you&#39;ll enter the game as a &quot;Visitor&quot;. A &quot;Visitor&quot; can only spectate what is happening in the game and is unable to place any bets. Log in to start placing bets.</li>
<li>Each round has 30 seconds in which customers can place bets, it is possible to &quot;Clear&quot; or change any bets during this phase. After this phase ends, it is no longer possible to make any changes to that bet.</li>
<li>As a shortcut, It is possible to increase the amount of your bet by clicking several times on the chip with the amount corresponding with the bet you wish to place.</li>
<li><p>An example:
You (customer A) bet 800 and customer B bets 200 on the Red.
Then, customer C bets 50, customer D bets 30 and customer E bets 20 on the Blue.
Furthermore, you placed a 100 &quot;Pair&quot; bet in the betting area of the &quot;Blue&quot; side for specific dice points.</p>
<p>So, during such a round, customers placed a total of 1000 on the &quot;Red&quot; side and placed a total of 100 on the &quot;Blue&quot; side.
The side which placed the lowest amount in bets was the &quot;Blue&quot; side, in which customers placed 100 as bets. This amount will become the &quot;Prize Pot&quot;. Then, the side who loses at the end of the round will see the amount placed in bets enter again the &quot;Prize Pot&quot;, which will then be distributed proportionally among the winner&#39;s side.
In this example, since the &quot;Red&quot; side was the side with the highest amount in bets and your bet was the most under the &quot;Red&quot; side, there will be 10 seconds in which you would be able to open the dice cup.</p>
<p>Situation 1) &quot;Red&quot; got 3, 5 and 6 as dice points and &quot;Blue&quot; got 2, 2 and 4 as dice points.
The winning side is the side with the highest sum of dice points. In this situation, the &quot;Red&quot; side would be the winner and rewards and payment would be given accordingly.
Then, the betting allocation would be:
You would win an extra 80, customer B would win an extra 20 over what you placed as a bet; thus, you would have a return of 880 and customer B would have a return of 220.
Note: kindly keep in mind that our Service Fee is charged over the amount won in the game. In this case, the Service Fee would be charged over the winnings of 80 for you and charged over the winnings of 20 for customer B.
Customer C would lose 50, customer D would lose 30 and customer E would lose 20 and all three of these customers would have no returns (customer C: 50-50=0; customer D: 30-30=0; customer E: 20-20=0).
Moreover, because the &quot;Blue&quot; side got a &quot;Pair&quot; of 2 and 2 dice points, you will also get a bonus of 100*2.3=230.</p>
<p>Situation 2) &quot;Red&quot; got 2, 2 and 4 as dice points and &quot;Blue&quot; got 3, 5 and 6 as dice points.
The winning side is the side with the highest sum of dice points. In this situation, the &quot;Blue&quot; side would be the winner and rewards and payment would be given accordingly.
Then, the betting allocation would be:
Customer C would win an extra 50, customer D would win an extra 30 and customer E would win an extra 20; thus, customer C would have a return of 100, customer D would have a return of 60 and customer E would have a return of 40.
Note: kindly keep in mind that our Service Fee is charged over the amount won in the game. In this case, the Service Fee would be charged over customer C&#39;s winnings of 50, customer D&#39;s winnings of 30 and customer E&#39;s winnings of 20.
You would lose 80 and customer B would lose 20. You would have no winnings and your return would be of 720 and customer B&#39;s return would be 180 (you: 800-80=720; customer B: 200-20=180).</p>
</li>
<li><p>A new round will start 3 seconds after rewards and winnings are distributed.</p>
