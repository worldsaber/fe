<p>1.1 All applicants must be over 18 years of age to place a bet or register with SportyBet. SportyBet reserves the right to ask for proof of age from any customer and suspend their account until satisfactory documentation is provided. SportyBet takes its responsibilities in respect of under-age gambling very seriously.</p>
<p>1.2 All information supplied when registering with the site MUST be accurate and complete in all respects. In particular, if using a credit or debit card, the cardholder&#39;s name MUST be the same as the name used when registering with the Website. Where this is not the case, the relevant account will be suspended. Where an account is suspended, the relevant customer should contact us. All bets that are placed prior to an account being suspended will stand - win or lose.</p>
<p>1.3 SportyBet may confirm a customer’s address by posting an address verification letter to the customer. All correspondence will be discreet and the envelope will not display any reference to SportyBet. When such correspondence is initiated, all offers and withdrawal requests may remain pending until the address has been confirmed as correct.</p>
<p>1.4 By accepting the Terms and/or registering to use the Website you hereby agree that we shall be entitled to conduct any and all such identification, credit and other verification checks from time to time that we may require and/or are required by applicable laws and regulations and/or by the relevant regulatory authorities for use of the Website and our products generally. You agree to provide all such information as we require in connection with such verification checks. We shall be entitled to suspend or restrict your account in any manner that we may deem in our absolute discretion to be appropriate, until such time as the relevant checks are completed to our satisfaction.</p>
<p>1.5 As part of the registration process, we may supply your information details to authorised credit reference agencies to confirm your identity. You agree that we may process such information in connection with your registration.</p>
<p>1.6 Customers may open only one account. Should we identify any customer with more than one account we reserve the right to close or suspend any such customer and SportyBet shall also be entitled to withhold and/or retain any and all amounts which would otherwise have been paid or payable to you (including any winnings or bonus payments).</p>
<p>1.7 Customers must keep their registration and account details up to date. This, and your account information, may be amended in the Personal Account section of the Website. If you require any assistance, please contact us.</p>
