<li><p>Why was my money deducted suddenly?</p>
<p>If a booker of ours provide the wrong information for the results of bets, bets will then also be cleared in accordance to the wrong results. When this happens, a Rollback notification will be sent if such a situation occurred to any of your bets. Then, we will re-settle any related bets in accordance with the real and correct final results. This process usually happens either during the match, or shortly after the game ends, when it’s being reviewed.</p>
<p>The Balance of your account may turn out to be negative after a Rollback. This happens when a customer spends his winnings or has withdrawn his winnings before the Rollback happened. SportyBet will compensate and put this amount back to 0 in a chronological order for part of the customers.</p>
