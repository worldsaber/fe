<ol>
<li><p>Deposits and Bets</p>
<p>1.1 You may only bet with the amount of cleared funds held in your account. Accordingly, if you want to place bets or participate in gaming, you must deposit monies into your account. Further details of how to deposit, withdraw and transfer funds can be found at Deposits/Withdrawals.</p>
<p>1.2 By depositing funds into your account, you direct us and we agree to hold them, along with any winnings, for the sole and specific purpose of using them (i) to place your sporting and gaming stakes; and (ii) settling any fees or charges that you might incur in connection with the use of our services (Purpose). We shall be entitled to suspend or close your account if we reasonably consider or have reason to believe that you are depositing funds without any intention to place sporting and/or gaming stakes. In such circumstances we may also report this to relevant authorities.</p>
<p>1.3 All funds that we hold for you are held in separate designated customer bank accounts to be used solely for the Purpose and the bank has acknowledged this. We must return the funds to you if they are not used for the Purpose.</p>
<p> The bank has acknowledged that your funds are held in those accounts solely for the Purpose. The bank has confirmed that it will not mix customers’ funds in those accounts with any other, including our own, and that it has no claim on the funds itself.</p>
<p> In view of the above, in the event of our insolvency, your funds are protected. The funds would still belong to you and would not fall into the hands of the liquidator.</p>
<p>1.4 You agree that we shall be entitled to retain any interest which might accrue on monies held in your SportyBet account.</p>
<p>1.5 No credit will be offered by any employee of SportyBet, and all bets must be supported by sufficient funds in the customer account. SportyBet reserves the right to void any bet which may have inadvertently been accepted when the account did not have sufficient funds to cover the bet. Should funds be credited to a customer&#39;s account in error it is the customer&#39;s responsibility to inform SportyBet without delay. SportyBet will recover such funds by account adjustment.</p>
<p>1.6 Unless otherwise stated, all examples given on the Website are given in NGN. For any transaction which requires a currency exchange, the applicable exchange rate will be the mid-rate as quoted by the Financial Times. The currency options available are listed in Appendix One to these Terms and Conditions and on the Website.</p>
<p>1.7 Once a currency is selected, funds are deposited, wagered and winnings paid in that currency. In order to transact in a different currency, you must close your existing account by contacting us and open a new account with your preferred currency.</p>
<p>1.8 SportyBet shall be entitled to withhold and/or retain any and all amounts earned or received by you as a result of or in connection with your ‘unauthorised’ use of the Website including activities which are not for an authorised purpose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Withdrawals</p>
<p>2.1 Where possible, all withdrawals will be processed to the payment account from which the deposits were made. Withdrawal payments can only be made in the name of and to the registered account holder.</p>
<p>2.2 Withdrawals can be processed by clicking &#39;Withdraw&#39; on the Website, subject to there being sufficient funds in your betting account.</p>
<p>2.3 If the value of a deposit is not played through in full before a withdrawal is requested, SportyBet reserves the right to make a charge to the customer’s account to cover all reasonable costs relating to both the deposit and withdrawal. If necessary, the value of the withdrawal requested may be reduced accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other</p>
<p>3.1 If we incur any charge-backs, reversals or other charges in respect of your account, we reserve the right to charge you for the relevant amounts incurred.</p>
<p>3.2 We may, at any time, set off any positive balance on your account against any amounts owed by you to SportyBet or any company within the SportyBet group.</p>
<p>3.3 You are responsible for reporting your winnings and losses to the tax and/or other authorities in your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>3.4 Internet gambling may be illegal in the jurisdiction in which you are located. If so, you are not authorised to use your payment card to complete the transaction. However, any bets/wagers accepted from such jurisdictions will stand - win or lose.</p>
