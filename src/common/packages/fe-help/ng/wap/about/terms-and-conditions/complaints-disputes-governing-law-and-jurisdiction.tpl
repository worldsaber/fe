<ol>
<li><p>Should there be any claim or dispute arising from a past or current transaction, please contact us. If SportyBet is unable to settle the dispute, SportyBet will refer the dispute to an arbiter, whose decision will be final (save in respect of any manifest error) subject to full representation given to all parties involved. No dispute regarding any bet/wager will result in litigation, court action or objection to a bookmaker’s licence or permit (including any remote operator’s licence or personal licence) unless SportyBet fails to implement the decision given by arbitration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Settlement of bets on American sports: In all cases bets on American sports will be settled using statistics and results as provided by each sport&#39;s governing body (obvious errors excepted). The relevant governing bodies are as follows, NFL, NCAAF, CFL, NBA, NCAAB, NHL, MLB, NASCAR, MLS and the PGA tour.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Subject to paragraph B.3.1 above, these Terms and Conditions and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter, whether of a contractual or non-contractual nature, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Nigeria.</p>
</li>
<li><p>By accepting these Terms and Conditions and/or placing bets or wagers and/or making use (whether authorised or not) of the facilities offered by SportyBet (whether through the Website or otherwise), you irrevocably agree that the courts of Nigeria shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute which may arise out of or in connection with these Terms and Conditions.
